							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p>Professionally, I'm essentially a Full Stack developer for Applications built in Microsoft Access or Excel.  A lot of what I've done is specifically for the company I currently work for, so I can't upload source code for most of it.  I can and have recorded videos explaining what they are and how they work.  In addition to that, I also am an amateur game developer, Twitch Streamer, and Youtuber.</p>

									<h3>Google Sheets Automation</h3>
									<p>This personal project was the result of a friend making an offhand comment.  They wanted an easy way to compare characters in a video game, so I made a way to filter and sort them.  You can see it in action <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxEY4TjD_lT0Vl1sqAWKngwoPq0ab7WIlb32idNpolI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
